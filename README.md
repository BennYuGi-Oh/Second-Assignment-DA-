### Project Title
Employee Attrition Analysis

### Objectives

This project Analyze and identify patterns in employee attrition to help the organization improve employee retention rates. It also analyze employee attrition, satisfaction, and department-specific metrics. 

* What is the attrition rate across different job roles and departments?

* How do hourly rates vary by department?

* What is the relationship between business travel and attrition?

* How satisfied are employees across departments?



### Project Overview

The goal is to help organizations understand these trends, address issues like burnout or dissatisfaction, and improve employee retention through targeted solutions, such as better compensation, support, or engagement initiatives. This analysis supports building a more stable and productiveÂ workforce.

The dataset contains information on:

Total number of employees: 1,470

Employees who left the company (attrition): 237

Current employees: 1,233

Attrition rate: 16.12%


The dataset includes attributes such as job roles, age groups, gender, marital status, department, and educational background.


1. Attrition by Department:

The majority of attrition occurs in the Sales department (46.6% of attrition cases).

2. 


### Data Sources

The primary source of this data is to ensure that the data contains relevant fields like department, job role, attrition status, hourly rate, job satisfaction, and business travel.


### Tools Used

* Power BI: For visualizations and reporting.

* Excel: For basic data cleaning and analysis.


### Data cleaning and preparation

* Remove duplicates.

* Handle missing values (e.g., by imputing or excluding them).

* Verify data types for each field.


### Data Analysis

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Ensure all necessary columns are clean, with no missing or invalid data.

Standardize categories (e.g., job roles, educational fields).



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis to identify patterns across different attributes.

Generate visualizations to highlight key trends (e.g., bar charts, pie charts).



### Data Visualization 

Bar charts for attrition by job role and department.

Pie charts for attrition rates, hourly rates, and job satisfaction by department.

Column charts for business travel and education field distribution.

Add slicers for better interactivity (e.g., filter by age, gender, or department).

Use conditional formatting to highlight critical values.

### Conclusion

Job roles such as Sales Executives and Research Scientists experience the highest attrition rates.
Roles like Human Resources and Healthcare Representatives have significantly lower attrition.

The R&D department has the highest proportion of attrition (38.55%), followed closely by Sales (35.59%) and HR (25.86%).
The number of employees who left and those still working is evenly distributed across education fields, suggesting education may not significantly impact attrition.
